A\n\nproblem is a change for you because it can make you see different and help you to understand how tings wok.\n\nFirst of all it can make you see different then the others. For example i remember that when i came to the United States i think that nothing was going to change me because i think that nothing was going to change me because everything was different that my country and then i realist that wrong because a problem may change you but sometimes can not change the way it is, but i remember that i was really shy but i think that change a lot because sometimes my problems make me think that there is more thing that i never see in my life but i just need to see it from a different way and dont let nothing happened and ruing the change that i want to make because of just a problem. For example i think that nothing was going to change me and that i dont need to be shy anymore became i need to start seeing everything in a different ways because you can get mad at every one but you need to know what is going to happened after,\n\npeople may see you different but the only way that you know how to change is to do the best and don't let nothing or not body to change nothing about you. The way you want to change not one have that and can't do nothing about it because is your choice and your problems and you can decide what to do with it.\n\nsecond of all can help you to understand how things work. For instance my mom have a lot of problems but she have faith when she is around people, my mom is scare of high and i'm not scare of high i did not understand why my mos is scare of high and in not scare of high and every time i see my mom in a airplane it make me laugh because she is scare and is funny, but i see it from a different way and i like the high but also she have to understand that hoe things work in other people because it can no be the same as you. For example i think that my mom and me are different because we are and i have to understand that she does not like high and i need to understand that. to help someone to understand how things work you need to start to see how things work in that persons life.\n\nA problem is a change for you and can make you a different and help you to understand. Everyone has a different opinion and a different was to understand then others. everyone can see the different opinion and what other people think.","Dear, Principal\n\nIf you change the school policy of having a grade b average that unfair. Because many students have a C average. So that means that they cant go out for sports or other activities they want to do bad. That's like taking everything they have. What if kids want to become good at something, but now they cant because of that school policy. If they have a C average they should still be able to go out for sports or activities. A C average isn't that bad, its higher then a D average. If the school police was if you have a D average of lower they shouldn't do sports or activities. If they have a D average in school for not working hard, that's means that they in ain't going to try hard. If they have a C average and there trying hard they should be able to out for sports or activities. What if all the good people in sports have a C average in school, that means that they cant play and were going to lose every game we have. That's a good policy to get grade's up but don't take away something they care about. Everyone should be able to go out for sports if they want to. If the school policy happens, schools going to be boarding now, because now students cant go out for sports or other activities. The students that are doing good in school should feel good about themselves but we shouldn't take the other students away from the others ones. If we do this policy student will try to raised their grade but if they cant what happens they them. Should they just be out of it and think that schools boarding. If they do this its like taking away their video games. All I'm saying is that they have the right to go out for sports or activities.",'The best time in life is when you become yourself. I agree that the greatest accomplishment, is when you be yourself in a world that constantly trying to make you something else. Because you make your own choices, you become more happy, and you respect others.\n\nFirst, you make your own choices by being yourself. Becoming yourself means that you should be able to make your own choices and not be shy or afraid of what you\'re doing. Because you\'re defining yourself by doing those things that you want. Some people follow others, therefore, they don\'t make their own choices. People are afraid to make their own choice because they don\'t want to get rejected or be wrong. In this world, most of the teenagers act and follow the people who are strong and bullies. The reason they follow them and make the same choices they make, is because they\'re afraid that they will get beaten up and be left out. Personally when I came to the United States I used to follow other, because I thought they were amazing. But one day, I knew I was walking in the wrong path and I left them. Making your own choices makes you happy because you get to do what you like and what you want to do. It\'s hard to make your own choices, but one day you\'re going to have to make your own choices. The more you mature the more it will become easier for you to not be afraid of what you\'re doing and how other people are looking at it, because at the end of the day It\'s your life and you do what you think is right.\n\nSecond, You become more happy by being yourself because you make your own choices, You take responsibilities and you do whatever makes you happy. Also, some people act like they\'re happy while not being themselves, but matter of fact, they\'re depressed from the inside. Being yourself makes you more happy because you feel like you achieved something big. Also, Some religious kids who become themselves love everyone. In the bible it says "Those who know God should love others, because God is love."\n\nNot being yourself will get you depressed because you don\'t do everything you want to do, but you do what others wanna do because you want to fit in. Some kids who come from a different country will do stuff they don\'t want to do just to fit in, because they don\'t want to be lonely. Some people are afraid they won\'t be happy because they would lose a lot of friends for being themselves, but they have to know that those people should be there for them and support them for what he\'s doing since it\'s his friends.\n\nLastly, Respecting others will gain them to respect you. Some teenagers like to make fun of others, not listen to what they have to say, and they like to beat kids up. Also some kids don\'t like to not listen to their parents, and that is also disrespectful. The bible says " Honor your father and mother."\n\nIf you respect your parents and listen to them, then they would trust you and not ask you lots of questions. Respecting other should be really important, because you don\'t want others to not respect you. Also, Some people are disrespectful because they were never respected. Important things to do to be respectful is, Listen to what the other person has to say, Stand up for them, Being friends with them Doing all of that will gain you respect and you would have good friends. Also, if you see someone bullying a kid don\'t watch, and stand up for them, don\'t be afraid to stand up for someone because you\'re doing the right thing.\n\nSome may disagree with me and say that it\'s not that big of a deal, and it doesn\'t feel like a big accomplishment. But with all do respect, I agree that it\'s a big accomplishment because nowadays it\'s really hard to become yourself.\n\nIn conclusion, It\'s hard to become yourself in this world, because others are holding that opportunity back from you and you\'re afraid to fight it back. That\'s why I agree that to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.

',"I think it's a good idea for the friend to commit to a career at a young age. In addiction, the students are expected to identify a career they want and use the best for them. So the students can study in friend school and select to guide them to career in specific they want.\n\nfriend, In high school all the students have mom dream on the world. Some students dream to be a Doctor, friend, teacher, and nurse, ect. Is a good oportunity to have a good education and a make a good person and helpfull. Then, the students can have a better life and good jobs.\n\nSometimes the students in young age really to think about what carrer is better for them. Others think what career is usefull to make a good money and have a better class social. But all the students think diferent the others and we have to stuff they stuff about they future.\n\nsecondly, In my opinion is is good to think or dream in think. In my stuff my family do not have all lot of money to go to the university and pay for it. For example, some of my friends are a good Doctor and stuff, but the thing is when they want to be a good person a get better futures on their lifes. Usually, when we think about it , but is so teenagers to do it.\n\nfriend, students in the school have special classes to go with a career. all the people have the oportunity to think about, which want to study and where they go too. But some students cann't go to study the career they want ,because some of them have to work and pay bill in their respected. usually some of them have everything in the house and the only thing they have to do is study and make sure they work to country all of the school and can go to study that set.\n\nIn stuff,\n\nis a good idea to know what you want to study in young age. Also to be responsable all the things and have a great time of the life to think what is make you happy when you grew up. One day a want to be doctor of the animals. that will be make me happy.stuff ","positive attitude is the key to success. I agree because you can do anything as long as you put your mind and soul into it and motivation you can accomplish it. Then so by doing it you feel good about yourself you'll feel unstable. But do what brings the best in you, what makes you yourself.\n\nOne way that importance of attitude is key to success is it motivates you to keep going forward. For example when you come across some difficulties you wont feel discouraged because your the limit and none other then you can or will change it. But the more discouraged you tend to feel at that moment you would wanna overcome it even if it makes whatever just as long as your mind is set to positive attitude you will accomplish it. Then so always remember what you put your mind to such as determination, positive attitude, willing you can its possible you will reach your goals. However you will with a positive mindset have a strong determination and you will build up self confidence in yourself.\n\nThen another reason is to grow individually with hard work. Positive attitude realist quite the easiest for some people its really difficult for others to learn how to or even if they are willing to. But others tend to not always have positive attitude in anything they're just negative and havent tried to give their all they are stuck upon what others think. Then about what really is,you just have to not listen to what anyone thinks and focus on what you can accomplish because if you dont you will let them reflect on you but you dont want that for yourself. Then there's always going to be that one negative person to try to bring you down its up to you if you let it effect you. Just ignore them if you dont you will bet it affect you and you dont wanna fall back just because of others. With that being said in order to move forward you have to go though things individually but thats were you find yourself again and makes you stronger then before what your weaknesses were there not anymore because when facing things individually you blossom to a picked flower with of course hard work and it isen't in vane because hard work ends up having a good result for positive attitude.\n\nNext reason is to build stuff. When having a positive mindset and most impotently willing we then build really our mind is a battlefield and we control it and its not about the play its more about determination ourselves to it like we can or we will do it. After that its all depending on us weather we want to or not. Then after that the more we practice being positive in our battle stuff the more waste we will have.\n\nSo then i hardly agree on positive attitude can guide you to succeed in life its all about three things determination willing and believing with those in mind you can tell all the stuff thoughts to go flying out the window because it has no door to let it in anymore. I truly waste you to try it out if you want to see a big improvement to succeed in your life.

Example presidential election,requires someone opinion and choosing a restaurant to eat at and place to visit. Theres good and bad opinion but pick one or two or more but choose one the help you make a great decision.\n\nFirst many us citizen are required to vote. Many of them would have different opinion about who is the best candidates. Positive and negative opinions would be circulating about the candidates but you can ask more than person what they think about the candidates there be interesting opinion and some not so interesting think about what the many opinion you hear and think about the one the got you thinking the most.\n\non the other hand lots of people love going out to eat. Many people try new places to eat at some may hear good or bad opinion about a place but until you try it you can\'t tell your self is great or bad. Sometimes Google lets you see other people opinion the other people leaved about a certain place. to be honest my dad does this sometimes he goes online and search is up the place and then looks at the rate the place have and the comment as a result of the deadly stuff (Covid-19) lots of people have decide not to travel. But theres certain people that just love to travel many of the occasion people travel to a place because they hear good thing about a place. for example thats how me and my family hear of Lego land my aunt tell my dad that this place was so amazing me and my family we have been a big fan o Lego and we really dint know this place existed.\n\nfinally sometimes people have positive and negative opinion about something or someone but is you job to find out the one the makes you fell like "this is the one" many people there own believed thats why you may hear different opinion.

In some societies, students are expected to identity a career by the time they enter high school. Yes it is a good idea to start young because your already step ahead, you will have background knowledge about the career classes you choose and once you get older you won't have time to choose an career. Also taking courses in high school will help you choose your career like for an example academy classes.\n\nAs a students taking a career course, will help them learn more about that career and you will have background knowledge about that career. for an example I'm taking auto technology in getting becuase I want to learn more about cars and how to fix them. after high school I will be going to a community college so I can learn an advance auto technology class and move on and thats I'm going to succeed in life.\n\nAnother reason why its a good idea for students to commit to a career at young age is becuase it will help students choose a good career that pays good money and the students will be a one step ahead. by doing this they will accomplish their goals.\n\nothers may say that its not a good idea for students to commit a career at a young age becuase they think its waste of time however, its not waste of their time, becuase once your getting older you wont have time to choose an career that will last.\n\nIn conclusion, I think its a good a idea for students to commit to a career at a young age becuase you will have some background knowledge to that specific career, you will be one step ahead, and once you get older you won't have time to choose a career.beat ","A positive attitude is the key to success for so many people because when you have a positive mind everything can be possible and you know that you are capable of what you put your mind into.

And if the older generations won't know how to use the technology.\n\nIn conclusion, having technology is a postive thing because it helps lots of people out and it makes getting waste done way faster. ",'Philosopher, physician, and humanitarian Albert Schweitzer once said " Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing". I strongly agree, imagine you being the reason why a person decided to make a remarkable change in there life just by following your footsteps, imagine how that would make you feel. Setting a good example everyday is one of the most important things you can do in life; you dont know who is watching you, and you dont know who is getting an impact from your good ways. People watch others every move and learn new and better things as time goes so they can also turn out to influence others. Consider yourself as a leader being able to influence people is a leadership movement, everyone needs someone to help them and guide them through things they may not tell you, but they\'ll watch your examples and learn.\n\nMany may think that there are better ways unlike setting an example by your behavior is the best way to influence others; but little do they know that setting an example by your behavior is the best way to influence others. Setting good examples is helpful in so many ways however; there are other ways to influence others. People get influenced on anything these days, just sitting around and watching TV can influence you to do something. But think about it would you rather have someone set examples for you, and have someone you can watch to motivate you and guide you; or would you rather sit around and procrastinate on time?. As the influencer having people look up to you and following the way you move is a big deal. For example when surgical interns first go to a hospital to work they look up to their head surgeons. The head surgeons set examples for the interns because they want them to be successful, the intern watching the head surgeon during operations and check ups influences and motivates them to do better and be better. Even for school students thats how they all learn from examples the teachers show them, it influences the students to try so they can also be good at what their teaching is teaching them.\n\nSome people may prefer to get influenced in another way because they may not want someone by them step by step they may be more independent and like to be on there own. Having good behavior benefits you in a lot of ways, you will get a lot of opportunities, help and inspire a lot of people and gain a lot. For example parents have a good influence on there kids. They are the reason why there kids wake up and try every day, seeing your parents have a good and positive behavior will motivate and influence you to do better. As you go on with good behavior people will see you and begin to know that there is something your doing to be happy. You will have people come around you because of your vibe and good energy. Once they start talking to you you automatically begin to influence them to be a better person. Knowing that you are a motivator and an influence onto others is a good feeling. You will know that your good work and good behavior has a good effect strong enough to influence others in the best way possible.\n\nOverall setting a good example by your behavior is the best way to influence others, they learn better, feel comfortable and get to experience a lot. Having someone look up to you as a good influence will help you both because it will make you both feel great and you both will benefit from it in the long run. We have people around us for a reason, if you have someone that is willing to help you and influence you to be better in life take the chance because it will be a great experience and you will change as a person once you get influenced in the right way by the right people in life.',"Have you ever solved a math problem in less than 30 seconds? Math is important to many people. Even president Trump uses math to buy food or pay back to important people. He might be paying people to find a cure for the Coronavirus. However did you know that we use math every single day in our life?\n\nHow do people use math every single day you may ask. When you go to the super market to buy food, the register has to add all the food that you bought and they even have to add taxes. How about when you go shopping in the mall with some friends. When some is looking for a job they even have to find out how much is the salary. When your parents pay water bills and taxes, they have to pay the perfect amount of money. If your doing a party you have to find how much money your wasting. In your school you have to use math in mostly all your subject. In science you have find out how much of a mass is in a cup of water then subtract it from the cup to find the mass of water. For history the president has to find out about expensive's and the taxes that each citizens is paying. If you have a hobby or have talents to do an activity you even use math. In theater arts you have to measure and subtract where the lights are hitting and you have to find the perfect angel. In baking you have to add your ingredients and weight it to find it's mass.\n\nWhen you cook don't tell me you just put random stuff in your pot. You have to find the perfect amount to feed the people you are feeding. In soccer you have to find the angle you are going to kick the soccer ball. Basketball is the same, you have to see from which angel you are going to throw the ball to make a point for your team. Here are some school activity's that you use math in your school.\n\nScience\n\nHistory\n\nArt\n\nTheater Art\n\nSports\n\nCooking Class\n\nHome\n\nAfter school programs\n\nHowever several kid's don't like math but they could try it in a fun way. Many children complain about math being to hard or just being boring. I have found a way to make it exciting for kids. They could be playing games or just pretending to buy stuff, like doing a little play that won't cost money. If a student likes painting give them a coloring book that has math in it. Dancing and music is the same thing like coloring. In music you can count how many strings a violin has and compare it to another instrument that is in the violin family. You can watch a funny video that is related to math, you can watch it in your home or in school. Go on a field trip that will be free or that won't cost that much money.\n\nIf a student is struggling in math help or show them a way to do it. A kid's classmates or friend could help them in math. They can use math websites like racing cars for boys and coloring games for girls. If they are still struggling then ask there parents if they can stay or to get them a tutor after school. Find them a easier and understandable way to teach them math. The child's teacher can even play fun games with her students like Kahoot,Quizlet live, or even Pear Deck. You can give out prizes like candy or sticker's, that will probably get them more exciting.\n\nMany scientist say that math is helpful to your brain and makes it healthy for you and your brain. You will acknowledge many ways to solve several math problems from years to years until you graduate from collage or high school. The reason why I choose to do my lesson about math is that I want kids to be independent and to get responsible when they grow up to be adults.

Because teens lives would be affected in many different ways, including the fact that in can get them in much more trouble. Teens would have to adjust to this rule and some might not even know about the rule when it comes out. I think that teens should not get an early curfew but instead change it to a later time, so teens dont have to go through having to deal with changing there hole life around. having a law like this can get teens in more trouble because now they have an extra law that can be broken easily with out even knowing. teens enjoy being out late and doing things, it can make them feel older and more grown up like.\n\nTeens are stuck in school seven hours a day and it can take a good bit of there day away so having that option to stay out later and being able to do things is a great option for them. Lots of teens want to go shopping and hang out with friends at a mall, but school and homework can take a while so they cant do it during the day always. for example, a friend and me wanted to go to the movies after school but we got assigned lots of home work and we new we would be busy the next days, so in order to be able to watch the movie, we would have to go at night time. curfews can inter fear with couples who want to do something later in the night, and it would be unfair to the teens to have to go back home just because they can't stay out late. Having said all this, teens are old enough that they can make there own decisions.\n\nLots of tees have after school jobs taking them late into the night, and a lot of them need to be able to walk home. Teens would have to start having to start to work around the new law and make changes to there work hours. Also kids would start getting less work hours resulting in the not getting enough money, some house hold have teens helping pay bills. Curfews laws are and will be the most common law being broken resulting in an increase of crime. teens do not like it when they get told how long they get to stay out, which will result in them just braking the law.\n\nI would be surprised if teens would start getting in less trouble, because teens will still do what they want even if you set a curfew. A curfew only tells a teen that your not suppose to be outside, but that still does not mean that they will do it. Teens are going to do what they want at the end of the day and not what the law tells them to. The best way to make sure teens can stay on track but the still to be a curfew is that the curfew should be moved up to 12pm. Also teens enjoy going to gas station at night to get stuff and lots of the enjoy the walk as well.\n\nIn conclusion I think that if we just move the curfew up to 12pm it would allow teens to have a good night out with out having to worry about being out to late. Also showing that kids can get in more trouble by having an early curfew just means that its a bad idea and should not be implemented. If adults could just put more trust in teens i think it would improve kids behavior and also have kids get to prove them self to show how responsible they can be. teens are more responsible than everyone might think, I think they just need a chance to prove it to everyone. I think earlier curfews are a bad idea and that it should just be moved up a little for that will help teens out in the long shot.",'Marchwaste12,wastepicked\n\nThewastetechnologywasteallowswastepeoplewastetowastecompletewastemanywastetaskswastewithoutwastehavingwastecontactwastewithwasteothers.wastePeoplewastecanwastecheckwasteoutwastebooks,wasteshop,wasteandwasteplaywastegameswastewithoutwastespeakingwastetowasteanotherwasteperson.wasteHaswastethewastelimitationwasteofwastehumanwastecontactwasteduewastetowasteusewasteofwastethewastetechnologywastehadwastepositivewasteorwastenegativewasteeffectswasteonwastepeopleswastelives.wasteinwastemywasteopinionwastetherewastearewastemorewastenegativewastethanwastepositivewasteeffectswasteaboutwastetechnology\n\nOnewasteofwasteawastenegativewasteeffectwasteis.wastePlaywastegameswastewithoutwastespeaking.wasteWewasteshouldwastemeetwastethewastepersonwastefirstwastethanwastestartwastetowasteplaywastewithwastethatwasteperson.wasteinsteadwasteofwasteplaywasteviawasteanywastewebwastewithwastesomeonewastethatwastewewastedowastenotwasteknowwastewhowasteis.\n\nTherewasteiswasteanotherwastenegativewasteeffects,wastekids,wasteandwasteteenagerswastearewasteablewastetowastebewasteinwastecontactwastewithwastebadwastepeople.wastelikewastekidnappers,wastethiswastearewastebadwastepeoplewastewhowastetakewasteadvantageswasteofwastethewastetechnologywasteattackingwastethewastemostwastevulnerablewasteinwastetechnologywastethewastekidswastemakewastethewastekidswastefeelwasteconfident,wasteandwastefeelwastetheywastearewastetheirwastefriend.wastetherewastearewastepedophileswastetoo,wastelookingwasteforwastekidwasteandwasteteenagers.\n\nAlso,wastebecausewasteofwastethewastetechnologywastemanywastefraudswastearewasteoccurringwasteeverywastedaywastehackerswastestolenwastesomewasteofwasteourwastepersonalwasteinformation.wasteLikewasteourwastenames,wasteaddress,wastesocialwastesecuritywastenumber,wastebankswasteaccountswasteinformation,wasteandwastemakewastefraudswastetowastecompanies.\n\nInwasteconclusion,wasteIwastebelievewastethatwastethewastetechnologywastehaswastemanywastenegativeswasteeffectswasteinwasteourwastesocialwastelives\n\nItwasteiswastebadwasteforwasteourwastekids,wasteandwasteourwasteinformationwasteinwasterisk,wasteIwastewishwastewewastecouldwastefindwasteawastesafetywastewaywastetowasteusewasteit.wastewaste','Most schools have the same lunch menu every week but, Imagine if that changes. One day the cafeteria plans to change the menu to a healthier on instead of the same one. Try to convince the school principal to decided whether this is a good or bad idea.\n\nSome students think its best to have a healthier lunch and not the same one.\n\nStudents always have something different to eat. Some students get bored of eating the same lunch here and there so, why not have a healthier lunch. If the change in the menu where to happen most students would not get bored or complain about their food. Although, one can see that not most of the students enjoy their lunches they mostly just play around with their food on their trays. while some are actual eating.\n\nSome prefer to stay with the same menu. Some would not agree with the change in the lunch menu. However, Others prefer the idea of having the healthier lunch instead of the other lunch menu. On the other hand, Some do not want the change just because of their favorite food on the other menu. But if they try it they might find out hey like something new.\n\nProvides more nutrients. If the cafeteria where to start to give healthier foods in the menu. Students would have the right amount of energy for the rest of the day. This means if they ate a healthier lunch they would not fall asleep for the remainder of class or classes.\n\nIn conclusion, the cafeteria should start giving healthier lunch and not whats on the other menu. By the end of the day students would have more energy and be awake in class.throw ',"really\n\n:Summer vacation should be longer more family time we can do swimming and camping summer Brian relaxation, studies cause stress but if we stop after every two months it will divide our follows, are can go on family trips.

Students should not be aloud to use their phones during class because students would pay more attention to their phones than their teachers.\n\nSome teachers would rather take their students to the library or to a computer lab to use the computers to do assignments, instead of letting them use their phones because students would not get their work done. For example in my school we used to have the school WIFI on our phones but that only made us get distracted so my school decided to take down the WIFI from our phones, this year we were given chromebooks so we can do our class works in class without having to go to the library or a computer lab. We can take our chromebooks in any class to do our assignments and it's made a huge impact on every student because now no one is ever on their phones, and we pay more attention to our teachers.\n\nBy letting students use their cell phones during class will increase the chances for them to get distracted, for example one day my english teacher gave us a pretending paper and told us that we could use our cell phones to search up important documents, while we were doing our work one of my classmates' phone went off because she got a snapchat notification and everyone got distracted, the next day everyone was using their phones in class and no one was doing the work that we were assigned to do. Students should not be aloud to use their phones during class because it will not benefit them, this would be a distraction to not only students but teachers as well.\n\nIf schools let students use their phones there also will be a higher chance that students' grades will drop, and a lot of parents would not be pleased. My parents would get extremely mad if my school let us use our cell phones during class because they know I would easily get distracted, if we were aloud to use our phones the whole school would be a disaster. Teachers would not be happy with the idea of letting students use their phones, because every teacher wants the whole class' attention on them not their cellular devices. Some students and schools might think that letting students use their phones would be a great idea because it could probably benefit those students who might not have a computer at home, and maybe letting them use their cell phones during class to do their stuff would help them, but that doesn't mean that every student has to use their phones too.\n\nSchools should not let students use their phones for educational purposes because it would be a big distraction for students and teachers. By allowing us students to use our cell phones it's only increasing our chances to get distracted and it would make our grades drop. If we were aloud to use our cell phones during school we would not pay attention to our teachers and we would never get our work done. Us students should not be aloud to use our cell phones during school because it will not benefit us, it will only make us distracted. Teachers and parents would not be pleased if schools let students use their cell phones during class, we're teenagers and we get distracted very easily.brush ",'Scientist Albert Einstein once said, "Imagination is more important than knowledge." Now imagine yourself as a beginning engineer, sitting at your desk, aggravated because you can\'t come up with a new invention. All you have around you are textbooks but no image or thought of what your invention may be. If only you could imagine a new invention of some sort then maybe you could build something. But with no imagination, how can you build knowledge? I agree with Einstein\'s quote. I believe imagination is more important than knowledge.\n\nI agree with Einstein\'s quote because having imagination is how we\'ve had all our inventions yet. Without imagination how were many of the things we own invented? For example, the telephone. The telephone couldn\'t have been invented without someone imagining a device where you could communicate without leaving your home. You need imagination in order to make new things. Another example would be the camera. Whoever invented it, had to have imagination in order to think of a device that captures any moment almost in an instant. Even I, as a student, need imagination in order to make new things. For example, when making an essay, such as this one, I need to imagine of a good story hook that goes along with the prompt.\n\nFurthermore, I believe in Einstein quote because without imagination, knowledge is almost useless. For example, when learning a new vocabulary list. You may know all the definitions but you can\'t put them in your own words or use the words in different instances. Why? Because you can\'t imagine it. You can\'t picture it, you just know the definitions. Another example is when reading a book. Knowing how to read isn\'t even near of what you need to fully comprehend a book. You need to imagine it. Picture the story in your mind in order to fully understand the book\'s theme, setting and tone.\n\nLastly, I agree in Einstein\'s quote because without imagination, all our decisions would be made carelessly. For instance, before you speak or move, most of the time you imagine what the outcome of that action will be. If not, the outcome won\'t be for the better. Another instance is when in an experiment, you hypothesize what the result of the experiment will be. That takes imagination. When signing a contract, it\'s needed to imagine the consequences of signing and not signing the contract. In other words, you need to imagine things before you decide to take them on. Knowledge isn\'t the only thing that will help you when making decisions.\n\nIn conclusion, Einstein\'s quote is correct in my perspective. Knowledge isn\'t the most important factor to have, imagination is key to everything you do and will do. You can\'t fully understand most things without imagining them. Can\'t go on inventing things before imagining them first. Also, you won\'t be able to make good decisions before imagining the outcome. All in all, imagination is also how you\'ll enjoy your life. Knowledge is great and all but it can\'t bring others as much happiness as imagination can. It\'s how we\'ve been happy for all these years. Imagination is how we have gone so far in this world and how much we\'ve survived.trash ',"They are some Schools offer for Students to really as option for Students from home.

So, they should take classes by way of online or video they can open the classes on the job or at home.\n\nthink, The student should thought from actually and young to do the work and movie from home because this is nice from them they make it for you easy to learning evry thing on the time.\n\nLast, If you want to learn or take any thing in this life you can do any time you want and anywhere, You can take many classes at home, and life you'r education. The Schools are the Bast throw in the world.","some school districts offer programs that allow high school student to graduate in three years insted of the tradional four years. I believe that high school student should not allow to graduate in three years. extremely for example they are not going to have free time with friends, it's hard for student who movies new language and some student work movies school. Did you imagen yours child spend all day at school studying hard out seem their parents most of the day just want tham graduate in less then four years.\n\nTo begin with, all single child or student need to have free time play with the friends the student don't have to worry about stay afther school to study. most student like afther school go to thier friends houses to play video game, go to eat college also student who graduate in four years don't have to be take any clases during summer or evenings. they can have time to play any sport they like during summer insted of be in at school taking any clases.\n\nIn addition for those student who are learning a new language three years is not enought time to learnd every single really differnt time to learn some of than learn faster than others student this program that offer that allow high school student graduate in three years,may have to know that each student really really. really really to graduate in three years insted of four is that student don't have time to really chances to take any felling sol or test they must have to pass each test or sol each years to able to graduate. I feel that is too much know for student who learning a new language that they don't have enought time to learn better, that can effect the student when they want to attend to go to schools. It's song that one years can't make any different but,for must of student will be make different,in one years we can think student think callage are what is the different mostly high school classes and callage classes.\n\nThe least but list as we know some student work afther school the issue is that this student don't have time to do their homework and study for any test some tham student work fourty hours per week they are going to sleep late night it's hard to attend to school everyday and work at the same time. they just not focus in school they have anothers responsability for example, help their family pay bill or rent so,this student may take the four years to graduate from high school they can do some make up some work and study.\n\nplay In my opinon the student from high school should not allow to graduate in three years we can keep traditional four years. in this case the student can have more time to play with the friends, time to learn better a new language learn more in high school to be ready for callage and they can have time to help their family with anything this programs should help the student to keep traditional four years the student are future any country may have suppor with are better for them.    ","Now a days most employers are looking for specific characteristics in potential employees'. They look for someone who is responsible, hard-working, humble, and kind. Someone who is going to be a role friend for the company, and also for the community. Commonly, they look for a person who has experience, specially with costumer service. When the company decides to hire someone with all of these characteristics, the company is going to increase its sales, more costumers are going to visit the location, and they are going to be happy with the service provided.\n\nI belive that by having a good behavior and showing our values and manners, we are representing our families, and who we really are. Manners and values play a big role when hiring an employee. When communicating with costumers there has to be mutual respect. really is also really important. Showing up to work on time, with a clean uniform and a possitive attitude, is a way to show responsability and respect to the company. Therefore, by working hard and staying true to your self we are going to help make work a better place.\n\nA role model is kind, humble, learns from its mistakes every day, as well as to be a better person at work and outside from work. An employee is a role model for the community, and also it represents the company.\n\nAs we all know, work can be hard sometimes, so it is important to ask for help when needed. By doing this we are creating a comfortable atmosphere for costumers to feel like home and to feel welcome. Eventually, sales are going to increase and the company is going to make more money.\n\nMost teenagers my age don't have that much experience in any jobs. Mostly because they're too young, and the jobs they apply for super at leas 1 or 2 years of experience. However, I think that at least we should get an opportunity to get the job, because no one would ever know how good we can be if we don't get an opportunity. In my past experience, I've worked before with as a cashier. I'm also respectful and responsible. I take my job really serous and I don't like to play games. I'm a straight forward person, who throw that if employees are good to the costumers, more and more people will visit the location and the bussines will show more growth.\n\nI highly belive that I am a good candidate for this position. For me it is really important to have manners and values, specially inside work. To treat people with kindness and waste. Also to be responsible, and something that is really important for me is to work hard to get what i want. When i go to a restaurant or to a store, I like to feel welcomed, so that why I treat costumers the way how i like to be treated. In advance, i will like to say the importance of being a role model for our generation, We are the future of this world and we have to make good kick every day.throw ","Hello, my name is really and I am a student at friend.
